## Filter Options

### Filter by Protein Accession

Select your proteins of interest from the dropdown menu. Any CSM or XL that does not
have at least one peptide corresponding to one of the selected proteins will be filtered
out. Leaving this option blank will not apply the filter.

### Filter by Crosslink Type

Select which type of crosslinks you are interested. Leaving this option blank will not
apply the filter.

### Filter by Target-Decoy Type

Select which database match types you are interested in. Option `Target-Decoy`
corresponds to both "Target-Decoy" and "Decoy-Target" matches. Leaving this option
blank will not apply the filter.

> **Please note that this filter will remove any CSMs and XLs that have missing target-decoy labels!**


## Inspect Your Filtered Results

After hitting the `Filter results!` button the data at the bottom of the page will update
and display your current CSMs and/or XLs and/or aggregated XLs after the filtering.
