# Visualizing Results

The `Visualize` tab will show some basic plots for your CSMs and/or XLs and/or
aggregated XLs.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Please note that the visualizations are heavily influenced by your pre-processing**
> **and filtering steps! E.g. filtering for target matches will obviously mean that**
> **`Target and Decoy` plots will only show target-target matches!**

- The `Target and Decoy Distribution` plot will show the number of "Target-Target",
  "Target-Decoy" and "Decoy-Decoy" matches in your results.
- The `Target and Decoy Score Distribution` plot will show the score distribution
  of "Target-Target", "Target-Decoy" and "Decoy-Decoy" matches in your results.

- The `Crosslink Type Distribution` plot will show the number of intra- and inter-links
  in your results.
- The `Protein Distribution` plot will show the top `n` proteins with the most crosslink
  evidence in terms of number of CSMs/XLs. It additionally shows the number of intra-
  and inter-links per protein. The `n` parameter is controlled via the `Visualization Parameters`
  section at the top of the page.

- The `Peptide Pair Distribution` plot is only available for CSMs and show the most frequently
  observed peptide pairs in your CSMs.
