# Introduction

The following sections will give you an overview of pyXLMS and get you familiar with
using pyXLMS as a python package. It is assumed that pyXLMS is already installed
on your system at this point, if not please refer to ➡️ [Installation](/docs/setup)!

## Abbreviations

The following abbreviations are commonly used throughout the documentation:

- **CSMs**: Crosslink-Spectrum-Matches ➡️ Crosslink associated with a specific mass spectrum.
- **XLs**: Crosslinks/residue pairs (_the two terms are used interchangeably_) ➡️ Two specific protein residues that are connected via a crosslinker.
- **FDR**: False-Discovery-Rate ➡️ Commonly used quality metric in proteomics.

## Following Along

Most of the following pages are based on [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks which are available from
[here](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/pyXLMS/tree/master/examples).

You can follow along via the following steps:

<Steps>
### Install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)

```bash copy
pip install jupyterlab
```

### Clone the [pyXLMS Repository](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/pyXLMS) 

```bash copy
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/pyXLMS.git 
```

### Change to the pyXLMS Directory

```bash copy
cd pyXLMS
```

### Launch JupyterLab

```bash copy
jupyter lab
```

### Run Example Notebooks

- Navigate to the notebook you want to run in the JupyterLab file browser and open it.
- Execute the cells from top to bottom.

</Steps>

## Introductory Content

The **Working with pyXLMS** section will introduce you to the
supported crosslink search engines and input formats \[[page](/docs/basics/supported_io#supported-search-engines-and-formats)\]
as well as supported output formats and down-stream analysis tools \[[page](/docs/basics/supported_io#supported-export-formats)\].
Moreover it will give an overview on how pyXLMS stores and encodes data as well as how to access that data \[[page](/docs/basics/data_types)\].
The pyXLMS specific file format for CSMs and XLs will also be introduced here \[[page](/docs/basics/format)\].
Finally, the section closes with instructions on how to create CSMs and XLs \[[page](/docs/basics/data)\].

> [!TIP]
>
> **We recommend reading through the whole `Working with pyXLMS` section which will make understanding of subsequent sections substantially easier!**
