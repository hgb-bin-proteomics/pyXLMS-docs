# Introduction

<br/>
<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>

**pyXLMS** is a python package and web application with graphical user interface that aims to simplify and streamline the intermediate step of
connecting crosslink search engine results with down-stream analysis tools, enabling researchers even without bioinformatics knowledge to
conduct in-depth crosslink analyses and shifting the focus from data transformation to data interpretation and therefore gaining biological
insight.

Currently pyXLMS supports input from seven different crosslink search engines:
[MaxLynx (part of MaxQuant)](https://www.maxquant.org/),
[MeroX](https://www.stavrox.com/),
[MS Annika](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika),
[pLink 2 and pLink 3](http://pfind.ict.ac.cn/se/plink/),
[Scout](https://github.com/diogobor/Scout),
[xiSearch](https://www.rappsilberlab.org/software/xisearch/) and [xiFDR](https://www.rappsilberlab.org/software/xifdr/),
[XlinkX](https://docs.thermofisher.com/r/XlinkX-3.2-Quick-Start-Guide/),
as well as the [mzIdentML format](https://www.psidev.info/mzidentml)
of the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative, and a well-documented and
[human-readable custom tabular format](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/pyXLMS/blob/master/docs/format.md).

Down-stream analysis is facilitated by functionality that is directly available within pyXLMS such as validation, annotation, aggregation, filtering, and visualization - and [much more](https://hgb-bin-proteomics.github.io/pyXLMS/modules.html) - of crosslink-spectrum-matches and crosslinks. In addition, the data can easily be exported to the required data format of the various available down-stream analysis tools such as
[AlphaLink2](https://github.com/Rappsilber-Laboratory/AlphaLink2),
[xiNET](https://crosslinkviewer.org/index.php),
[xiVIEW](https://www.xiview.org/index.php),
[xiFDR](https://www.rappsilberlab.org/software/xifdr/),
[XlinkDB](https://xlinkdb.gs.washington.edu/xlinkdb/),
[xlms-tools](https://gitlab.com/topf-lab/xlms-tools),
pyMOL (via [pyXlinkViewer](https://github.com/BobSchiffrin/PyXlinkViewer)),
ChimeraX (via [XMAS](https://github.com/ScheltemaLab/ChimeraX_XMAS_bundle)),
or [IMP-X-FDR](https://github.com/vbc-proteomics-org/imp-x-fdr).
